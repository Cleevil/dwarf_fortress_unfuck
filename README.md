Unfucking Dwarf Fortress
========================

As we know, Dwarf Fortress is, most sadly, closed source. However, the multimedia
layer for font rendering, audio output and graphics is open source. The problem
is that the source is somewhat fucked with no clear way to build it and no official
upstream source repo.

This repo exists to track upstream changes, to provide a build system and to unfuck
the code a little bit.
